##Autonomous Drone Autolanding Using AoA Techniques
This repository contains a Python script designed to autonomously land drones by leveraging Angle of Arrival (AoA) techniques. By processing data from onboard sensors and integrating with the ROS (Robot Operating System) and MAVROS, the script enables precise and safe landing operations in varying environments. The core algorithm calculates optimal landing paths by considering the AoA data and environmental context captured through the drone's sensors.
